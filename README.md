# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN 500 WORDS

The task performed in this assignment involves developing a File Handling Utility using Java to understand and implement basic file operations. File handling is an essential concept in programming as it enables applications to store data permanently and retrieve it when required. In this task, Java’s java.io package is used to perform file operations such as writing, reading, and modifying data in a text file.

The program is designed to create a file and write initial content using the FileWriter class. It then reads the file contents line by line using FileReader and BufferedReader and displays the output on the console. Further, the program appends additional data to the same file without removing existing content by using the append mode of FileWriter. Proper exception handling is implemented using try-catch blocks to handle input-output errors. This task helps in understanding practical usage of Java file handling and its importance in real-world applications.
